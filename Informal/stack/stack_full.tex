\subsection{The function \stackfull}
\Label{sec:stackfull}

The function \stackfull is the runtime version of the predicate \logicref{StackFull}.

\input{Listings/stack_full.h.tex}

As in the definition of the predicate \StackFull the implementation of
\stackfull in the next listing simply checks whether the
size of the stack equals its capacity.

\input{Listings/stack_full.c.tex}

Note that with our definition of stack equality (\S\ref{sec:stack-equality})
there can be equal stack with different capacities.
As a consequence, there can are equal stacks where one is full while the other is not.
In other words, \stackfull is not well-defined!
