\subsection{The function \stacksize}
\Label{sec:stacksize}
\Label{sec:stacksizewd}

The function \stacksize is the runtime version of the logic function
\logicref{StackSize}.
The specification of \stacksize in the following listing
simply states that \stacksize produces the same result as \StackSize.

\input{Listings/stack_size.h.tex}

As in the definition of the logic function \StackSize the implementation of
\stacksize in the next listing simply returns the field \inl{size}.

\input{Listings/stack_size.c.tex}

The next listing shows our check whether \stacksize is well-defined.
Since \stacksize neither modifies the state of its \stacktype argument 
nor that of any global variable we only check whether it
produces the same result for equal stacks.
Note that we simply may use operator~\inl{==} to compare integers since we
didn't introduce a nontrivial equivalence relation on that data type.
