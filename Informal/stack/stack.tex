\Label{cha:stack}

So far we have used the \acsl specification language for the task of specifying and verifying
one single \isoc function at a time.
%
However, in practice we are also faced with the task to implement a
family of functions, usually around some sophisticated data structure,
which have to obey certain rules of interdependence.
%
In this kind of task, we are not only interested in the properties of a
single function but also in properties describing how several function play
together.

The \cxx Standard Library provides  a generic container adaptor
\inl{stack} \cite[\S 26.6.6]{cxx-17-draft} whose signature and
behavior we try to follow as far as our \isoc implementation it allows.
For a more detailed discussion of our approach to the formal verification
of \stacktype we refer to Kim VÃ¶llinger's thesis \cite{Voellinger_2013_da}.
%

A \emph{stack} is a data type that can hold objects and has the
property that, if an object $a$ is \emph{pushed} on a stack
\emph{before} object~$b$, then~$a$ can only be removed (\emph{popped})
after~$b$.
%
A stack is, in other words, a \emph{first-in, last-out}
data type (see~Figure~\ref{fig:stack}).
%
The \emph{top} function of a stack returns the last element
that has been pushed on a stack.

\end{figure}

We consider only stacks that have a finite \emph{capacity}, that is,
that can only hold a maximum number~$c$ 
of elements that is constant throughout their lifetime.
%
This restriction allows us to define a stack without relying
on dynamic memory
allocation.
%
When a stack is \emph{created} or \emph{initialized}, it contains
no elements, i.e.,
its \emph{size} is~0.
%
The function \emph{push} and \emph{pop} increases and decreases
the size of a stack by at most one, respectively.

\section{Methodology overview}
\Label{sec:Methodology Overview}

Figure~\ref{fig:Methodology Overview}
gives an overview of our methodology to specify and verify abstract
data types (verification of one axiom shown only).

What we will basically do is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  specify axioms about how the stack functions should
  interact with each other
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-axioms}),
\item  define a basic implementation of \isoc data structures
  (only one in our example, viz.\\
  \inl{struct Stack};
  see \S\ref{sec:stack-definition})
  and some invariants the instances of them have to obey
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-invariants}),
\item  provide for each stack function an \acsl contract and a 
  \isoc implementation 
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-functions}),
\item  verify each function against its contract
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-functions}),
\item  transform the axioms into \acsl-annotated \isoc code
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-verification}), and
\item  verify that code, using access function contracts and
  data-type invariants as necessary
  (\S\ref{sec:stack-verification}).
\end{enumerate}

\S\ref{sec:stack-equality}
provides an \acsl-predicate deciding whether two instances of a
\inl{struct Stack} are considered to be equal (indication by ``$\approx$''
in Figure~\ref{fig:Methodology Overview}), while
\S\ref{sec:stackequal} gives a
corresponding \isoc implementation.
The issue of an appropriate definition of equality of data instances
is familiar to any \isoc programmer who had to replace a faulty
comparison \inl{if(s1 == s2)} by the correct 
\inl{if(strcmp(s1,s2) == 0)} to compare two strings 
\inl{char *s1,*s2} for equality.
