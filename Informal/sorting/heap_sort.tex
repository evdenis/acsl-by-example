\section{The \heapsort algorithm}
\Label{sec:heapsort}

The \heapsort algorithm has the signature

\begin{lstlisting}[style = acsl-block]

  void heap_sort(value_type* a, size_type n);
\end{lstlisting}

It relies upon the heap algorithms discussed in Chapter~\ref{cha:heap}
to efficiently transform the array into increasing order.

\subsection{Formal specification of \heapsort}

The following Listing shows the specification of \heapsort.

\input{Listings/heap_sort.h.tex}


\subsection{Implementation of \heapsort}

The implementation of \heapsort, shown in the next listing is straightforward.
%
Given the input array \inl{a[0..n-1]}, we use \specref{makeheap} to
arrange it into a heap; after that, we call \specref{sortheap} to
sort this heap into increasing order.
